# Designing-a-system-to-predict-breast-cancer-malignancy

Undergraduate research project - layout and notes tailored towards supervisor/project markers.

Using machine learning to predict whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant using tumour nuclei data the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

Investigating the performance of scikit-learn algorithms and a "from scratch"/independently coded logistic regression, comparing with and without Chi2, ANOVA and feature coefficient feature selection methods.

Python notebooks numbered 1-6 contain code for results included in this project's report.
